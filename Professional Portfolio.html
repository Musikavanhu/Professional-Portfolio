    <p class="row:after">In Earth's future, a global crop blight and second Dust Bowl are slowly rendering the planet uninhabitable. 
        Professor Brand (Michael Caine), a brilliant NASA physicist, is working on plans to save mankind by transporting Earth's
         population to a new home via a wormhole. But first, Brand must send former NASA pilot Cooper (Matthew McConaughey) 
         and a team of researchers through the wormhole and across the galaxy to find out which of three planets could be mankind's new home.
        </p>
        <br>
    <p> Why did Mann want to kill Cooper and the rest of the 
    crew? Mann's planet is not fit for habitation. But he conceals this from Amelia, Cooper and Romilly. He intends to take the embryos 
    and head to Edmunds, leaving the rest behind for the dead. </p>
