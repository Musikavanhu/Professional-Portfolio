This project was interesting, I got a lot done but mainly creating the grids and mainly the formatting took the longest, I am considering switching to part time at my job because I enjoyed working on the design a lot. I felt a sort of depth when it came to the possibilities of designing. Im excited to in the future add java so we can make these webpages even more engaging.
